# WebMail — Web-Based Email Application

A college project demonstrating real-world email communication using Django and Python's `smtplib`. Users can register, log in, compose and send emails (with CC and attachments), and view their sent history — all through a browser-based interface.

---

## Features

- **User Authentication** — Register, login, and logout. Only authenticated users can send emails.
- **Compose Email** — Fill in To, CC (multiple addresses), Subject, Body, and an optional file attachment.
- **SMTP Sending** — Emails are sent through Gmail's SMTP server using Python's built-in `smtplib` and `email.mime` libraries.
- **Sent Folder** — Every sent email is saved to the database and viewable per user.
- **Email Detail View** — Click any sent email to see full details including the attachment download link.
- **File Attachments** — Supports PDFs, images, and other common file types.
- **Validation & Error Handling** — Form validation and SMTP error messages shown in the UI.

## Setup & Running

### 1. Clone and create the virtual environment

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd project
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install django python-dotenv
```

### 2. Configure Gmail credentials

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```
EMAIL_HOST_USER=you@gmail.com
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx
```

> **Gmail App Password required.** Your regular Gmail password won't work.
> To generate one: Google Account → Security → 2-Step Verification → App Passwords.

### 3. Apply migrations

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### 4. Run the server

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Open [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) in your browser.

## How It Works

1. The user registers and logs in via Django's auth system.
2. On the Compose page, the form is submitted with `multipart/form-data` to support file uploads.
3. Django's view builds a `MIMEMultipart` message, attaches the body as `MIMEText`, and encodes any uploaded file as a `MIMEBase` attachment.
4. A raw SMTP connection is opened to `smtp.gmail.com:587`, upgraded to TLS via `STARTTLS`, and the message is sent using the credentials from `.env`.
5. On success, the email details are saved to the `SentEmail` table in SQLite and the user is redirected to the Sent folder.
